2022_Barenholtz_ReasoningCognition.pdf
```

## Priority Papers to Find First

1. **Barbour's recent work on complexity** (post-2020)
2. **Barenholtz on reasoning/cognition** (especially any mentioning auto-regression)
3. **Reviews on neural Markov models**
4. **Geometric deep learning surveys**
5. **Papers connecting transformers to Markov processes**

## Note-Taking Tips

1. **First Pass**: Skim abstract, introduction, conclusion
2. **Key Questions**:
   - How does this relate to auto-regressive Markov processes?
   - What mathematical tools are used?
   - What are the limitations mentioned?
3. **Cross-References**: Note other papers cited that seem relevant
4. **Implementation Details**: Flag any code/algorithms mentioned

## Organization

After downloading:
1. Save PDF in appropriate subdirectory
2. Create markdown notes file with same base name
3. Update bibliography.md with citation
4. Add to review checklist in README.md
