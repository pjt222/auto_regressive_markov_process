## Recent Publications and Research Activities (2023-2024)

### Published Papers

#### 1. Visual Fixations During Processing of Time-Compressed Audiovisual Presentations (2024)
- **Authors**: Nicole D. Perez, Michael J. Kleiman, Elan Barenholtz
- **Date**: January 2024
- **Summary**: Investigated how time-compression affects comprehension, finding that under challenging auditory conditions, people have a greater tendency to fixate regions closer to a speaker's mouth
- **Relevance**: While not directly about autoregression, this work examines how humans process compressed information streams, which has implications for understanding sequential information processing

#### 2. An Imagination – Procrastination Link? The Role of Efficacy Beliefs, Visual Imagery, and Affect in Academic Procrastination (2023)
- **Authors**: Meir Graff, Elan Barenholtz
- **Journal**: Psychological Reports
- **Date**: April 2023 (published online), appearing in print 2025
- **DOI**: 10.1177/00332941231168559
- **Key Findings**:
  - Self-efficacy for self-regulatory behavior was the strongest predictor of lower rates of academic procrastination
  - This effect was significantly greater for individuals who scored higher on visual imagery measures
  - Examines the relationship between mental imagery capacity and cognitive self-regulation
- **Relevance**: Explores cognitive mechanisms of self-regulation and mental imagery, which relate to internal model generation and prediction

### Grant-Funded Research (2024)

#### Early Prediction of ADRD Using Machine Learning (2024)
- **Funding**: $37,500 from FAU Stiles-Nicholson Brain Institute Masterminds Program
- **Project**: "Early Prediction of ADRD on Preclinical Assessment Data Using Machine Learning Tools"
- **Collaborators**: María de los Ángeles Ortega (College of Nursing) and others
- **Relevance**: Applies machine learning to predict cognitive decline, potentially using sequential/temporal modeling approaches

## Research on Consciousness and Cognitive Reasoning

### Center for Future Mind Activities
As Associate Director of FAU's Center for Future Mind, Barenholtz is engaged in research on:
- The "hard problem" of consciousness
- Conscious versus unconscious processing mechanisms
- Phenomena like blindsight and continuous flash suppression
- The neural basis of conscious experience

### Theoretical Approach
Barenholtz employs a computational neuroscience approach, using neural networks embedded in robotic systems to study brain function and behavior. His goal is developing a broad theoretical framework of neural function that bridges perception, cognition, and action.

## Connection to Autoregression and Language Models

While no direct publications on autoregressive models or LLMs were found in the 2023-2024 period, several aspects of Barenholtz's work relate to these areas:

1. **Sequential Processing**: His work on time-compressed audiovisual processing examines how humans handle sequential information under cognitive load

2. **Predictive Processing**: Research on visual perception and object recognition inherently involves predictive models of sensory input

3. **Machine Learning Applications**: The ADRD prediction project likely involves temporal/sequential modeling of cognitive assessment data

4. **Computational Modeling**: His use of neural networks to study brain function connects to broader questions about how artificial systems can model cognitive processes

## Related Work at FAU

### Context: Autoregression Research at FAU
While not directly from Barenholtz's lab, FAU's Pattern Recognition Lab has been working on:
- Large Language Models for medical report generation from X-ray transcriptions
- Applications of LLMs in medical contexts
- Abstractive question answering using transformer models

### The "Embers of Autoregression" Paper
A significant 2024 PNAS paper titled "Embers of Autoregression: Understanding Large Language Models Through the Problem They are Trained to Solve" (McCoy et al., 2024) provides theoretical framework for understanding LLMs through their training objective of next-word prediction. While Barenholtz is not an author, this represents the type of theoretical work connecting cognitive science to language models.

## Summary and Relevance to Autoregressive Markov Processes

Dr. Barenholtz's recent work, while not explicitly focused on autoregressive models or language models, touches on several relevant themes:

1. **Sequential Information Processing**: Understanding how humans process time-compressed sequential information
2. **Predictive Cognition**: Mental imagery and self-regulation involve internal predictive models
3. **Machine Learning for Cognition**: Applying ML to predict cognitive trajectories
4. **Consciousness and Computation**: Theoretical work on the relationship between conscious processing and computational models

His computational neuroscience approach and interest in developing broad theoretical frameworks of neural function position him well to contribute to understanding the cognitive and neural basis of sequential prediction, which underlies both human cognition and autoregressive language models.
