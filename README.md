# Auto-Regressive Markov Process Research

A research project exploring the intersection of auto-regression, Markov processes, complexity theory, and geometric computation.

## Overview

This project investigates the combination of:
- **Auto-regression** techniques (similar to LLM reasoning)
- **Hidden Markov processes** where each self-feed of the autoregressive process represents one Markov step
- **Embedding/vector space** grounding based on "complexity" concepts from Julian Barbour's work
- **Geometric shape-based calculations** with n-dimensional embeddings

## Project Status

Currently in the **literature review phase**. See the `literature/` directory for collected papers and review progress.

## Getting Started

1. Review the initial concepts in `initial_scribbles.md`
2. Check the literature collection progress in `literature/README.md`
3. Follow the review plan in `literature/review_plan.md`
4. Use `literature/collection_guide.md` to find key papers
