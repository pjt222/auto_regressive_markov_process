# Next Session Starting Point

## Session Summary (2025-01-16)

### What We Accomplished
1. ✅ Set up project structure with organized literature directories
2. ✅ Initialized git repository with proper .gitignore
3. ✅ Completed comprehensive literature searches:
   - Elan Barenholtz's work on sequential processing
   - Julian Barbour's complexity framework and shape dynamics
   - The Gray Cuber's geometric computation methods
   - Extensive bibliography on autoregression-Markov connections
4. ✅ Created initial synthesis connecting all four research areas
5. ✅ Identified key research questions and emerging framework

### Current Project State
- **Phase**: Literature Review (initial collection completed)
- **Git**: 2 commits, all changes tracked
- **Key Finding**: Strong theoretical connections between all four research areas
- **Framework Emerging**: Autoregressive Markov Processes in Shape Space

## Next Session Priorities

### 1. Deep Reading Phase
Start with the key papers identified in:
- `literature/markov_processes/key_papers_summary.md` (has reading order)
- Focus on: "Are Transformers Markov Chains?" (2024) as starting point

### 2. Mathematical Formalization
Begin drafting mathematical framework based on initial synthesis:
- Define state space using Barbour's shape dynamics
- Formalize autoregressive transition operators
- Prove conditions for Markov property preservation

### 3. Download Key Papers
The bibliography is ready, but PDFs need to be downloaded:
- Start with top 10 papers from key_papers_summary.md
- Remember: PDFs are git-ignored for copyright reasons

### 4. Create Proof-of-Concept Plan
Design minimal experiment to test core ideas:
- Simple autoregressive model with geometric constraints
- Complexity tracking during generation
- Compare different embedding strategies

## Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /mnt/d/dev/p/auto_regressive_markov_process

# Check project status
git status
git log --oneline

# View synthesis
cat literature/reviews/initial_synthesis.md

# View next papers to read
cat literature/markov_processes/key_papers_summary.md
```

## Key Files to Review
1. `literature/reviews/initial_synthesis.md` - Current understanding
2. `literature/markov_processes/key_papers_summary.md` - Reading list
3. `initial_scribbles.md` - Original vision
4. `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidance

Good night! The project is in great shape for continued research. 🌙
